## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- A Supabase account
- An OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd brain-brawl
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

4. Configure your environment variables in `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

5. Set up the database:
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Navigate to the SQL Editor
   - Run the SQL from `supabase/schema.sql` to create all tables and policies

6. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Database Schema

The app uses the following main tables:
- `profiles` - User profile information
- `rooms` - Study room data with unique codes
- `room_members` - Room membership and roles
- `uploads` - Uploaded study materials metadata
- `units` - Topic/unit selections for quizzes
- `quiz_sessions` - Quiz session lifecycle
- `quiz_questions` - Generated question bank
- `quiz_answers` - User answers and scoring
- `player_progress` - Real-time progress tracking

## How It Works

1. **Create/Join Room**: Users create a room or join with a code
2. **Upload Materials**: Upload PDFs, documents, or study materials
3. **Select Topics**: Choose what specific topics to be quizzed on
4. **AI Generation**: AI analyzes content and generates quiz questions
5. **Real-time Quiz**: All players answer questions simultaneously
