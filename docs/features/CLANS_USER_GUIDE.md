# Clans & Classrooms - User Guide

## What Are Clans?

Clans are private groups (like classrooms or study groups) where members can:
- Compete on private leaderboards
- Participate in clan-wide quiz sessions
- Track progress together
- See member stats and rankings
- Collaborate on learning goals

## Freemium Model

**Key Principle**: Only the **creator** needs Pro - **members** can join for free!

- 👨‍🏫 **Pro Users** (Teachers/Organizers): Can CREATE clans
- 👨‍🎓 **Free Users** (Students/Participants): Can JOIN clans

This means one teacher's Pro account ($4.99/month) can support an entire classroom of students using free accounts!

### "You can only join up to 3 clans"
- **Solution**: Leave a clan you're no longer using, or upgrade to Pro to join up to 10 clans

### "Clan not found"
- **Solution**: Double-check the join code (8 characters, case-insensitive)
- Make sure the code hasn't expired or been changed

### "This clan is full"
- **Solution**: Contact the clan owner to increase the member limit or wait for a spot

### "You are already a member"
- **Solution**: You're already in this clan - check your clan list

## Tips for Teachers

1. **Use Descriptive Names**: Make clan names clear (e.g., "AP Bio Period 1" not "Bio1")
2. **Set Appropriate Limits**: 50 members is usually enough for a class
3. **Keep Codes Private**: Only share with intended members
4. **Regular Sessions**: Host quiz sessions regularly to keep engagement high
5. **Monitor Progress**: Check the leaderboard to see who needs extra help

## Tips for Students
