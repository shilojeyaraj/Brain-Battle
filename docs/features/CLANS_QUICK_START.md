# Clans/Classrooms - Quick Start Guide

## What Are Clans?

Clans are private groups (like classrooms or study groups) where members can:
- Compete on private leaderboards
- Participate in clan-wide quiz sessions
- Track progress together
- See member stats and rankings

## Freemium Model

**Key Principle**: Only the **creator** needs Pro - **members** can join for free!

- 👨‍🏫 **Pro Users** (Teachers/Organizers): Can CREATE clans
- 👨‍🎓 **Free Users** (Students/Participants): Can JOIN clans

## Quick Setup

### For Teachers (Pro Account Required)

1. **Upgrade to Pro** ($4.99/month)
2. **Create a Clan:**
   - Go to Dashboard → Clans
   - Click "Create Clan"
   - Enter name: "AP Biology 2024"
   - Get your 8-character join code (e.g., "ABC123XY")
3. **Share the Code** with your students
4. **Host Sessions:**
   - Create quiz sessions for the entire clan
   - All members can participate
   - Track results on clan leaderboard

### For Students (Free Account Works!)

1. **Get the Join Code** from your teacher
2. **Join the Clan:**
   - Go to Dashboard → Clans
   - Click "Join Clan"
   - Enter the 8-character code
3. **Participate:**
   - Join clan quiz sessions
   - Compete on leaderboard
   - View your stats

## Example Workflow

### Classroom Scenario

**Teacher (Pro):**
```
1. Creates "AP Biology Period 1" clan
2. Gets code: "BIO2024A"
3. Shares code with 30 students
4. Hosts weekly quiz sessions
```

**Students (Free):**
```
1. Join using code "BIO2024A"
2. Participate in quiz sessions
3. Compete on class leaderboard

**Result**: 1 Pro account ($4.99/month) = 30 free participants!
