Place audio files here to enable richer SFX:

- click.mp3
- correct.mp3
- wrong.mp3
- level-up.mp3
- streak.mp3

Notes:
- Keep files short (< 0.8s) and lightweight.
- Use subtle UI sounds for clicks; brighter for rewards; dull for wrong answers.
- The app gracefully falls back to a small WebAudio beep if files are missing.
